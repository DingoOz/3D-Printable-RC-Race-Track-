3D Printable RC Race Track

**Summary**
This repo provides a set of printable "lengths" or "lines" which can be combined to form the markings of a 1/10 scale RC car racetrack.

**Challenge**
Often when building autonomous robots based on RC Car platforms, a large amount of space is required for a suitable track. This track is often created useing tape of some kind.
When testing, access to a track is iteratively required. Where it is not possible to leave tape affixed, a portable and rapidly deployable 'racektrack' is required. 

The goal is to be able to deploy line markings:
* quickly;
* onto a hard surface (concrete, carpet, asphalt etc);
* requiring minimum use of adhesive;
* which leave no trace after deployment; and
* are reusable.

**Proposed Solution**
The solution presented here uses 3D Printing (FDM) to create a series of inter-linking plastic components which can form the desired track.

The targeted 3D printer has a build area of 25cm x 20cm. The minimum track roughtly occupies a 6m x 6m space. Hence many pieces are required. 

For the outside lines each piece is roughly 20cm long and forms either a straight line or a curve with either 1.2m radius or 2.4m radius.

Each piece interlocks with each other piece in a uniform manner. Any individual piece can be flipped over and still interlock. 


**Design**
The design attempts to comply with the DIYrobocar rules (se "Track Specs here": https://diyrobocars.com/110th-scale-race-rules/)

The outside line markings are white, with the inside centre line yellow and black.

Deviations from the rules include:
* the centerline is only 25mm width not 35mm-55mm


**Printing**
Recommended to use .2mm layers. No supports are required. Suggest printing in batches as large as the print surface allows.
